# FAQ

### Which browsers are supported?

Everything should work fine on all modern browsers.

### Why not supporting windows?

Because I've developed the tool on Unix with the idea of self-hosting it on raspberry. As long as You run the app
inside the provided docker infrastructure, everything should work fine.

### Why is this free?

Because I've initially made it for myself, and the goal was to store my private data locally. Even though I thought
about monetizing it, but hosting user sensitive data without proper infrastructure? It's like asing for troubles.

### How long did You worked on it?#

- **version 1.x** - 2 years, day after day, weekend after weekend (in free time),
- **version 2.x** - that's tricky because I've already had the GUI and components ready from my other projects, so in this
  case rewrite took just few months,

### Do You plan to support this project?

Yes and, also no. The thing is that the project is pretty much doing all I need. I've reached the point where I got in
it just all I want. Naturally like always I got a lot of ideas for this project however I will only implement the things
that I really need to have, need to fix or update.

### Are there any issues/bugs in the project?

You've guessed! Yes.

I reduced all the errors/bugs to the minimum because as I wrote, I use this project on my own. I don't want one day to
see my data being, gone due to some bug. Naturally bugs are always there sometimes we just don't know about them.

The most important thing to understand is that the project is stable, and ready to be used the way it should be used,
which means that if there is a date field, then why trying to insert the string, or javascript call in the input, why
destroying Your very own instance of manager?
