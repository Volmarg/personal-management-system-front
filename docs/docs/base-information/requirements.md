# Requirements

## Software

- `docker` min. `26.1.1`,
- `docker-compose` min. `2.27.0`,
- `git` (optional),

## Hardware

Minimum:
- `CPU` (anything that is **not** a potato should be fine),
- `512MB RAM` (theoretically `256MB` should be fine too),
- `500MB - 1GB HDD`

::: info
Keep in mind that usage will most certainly increase over time, depending on amount of records / data You have in Your
project instance.

Logically dev-mode will take even more space.

## Other

- `internet connection` (for initial setup),
